    Hi! We are Group 6 and we believe it is important to preserve this object because it is significant to understand the different ranges of sunscreens that have existed, not only for consumers but also for dermatologists and manufacturing companies alike. In doing so, consumers can become more educated and manufacturing companies can collect information that will better suit the type of consumer they are aiming to cater to. In addition, preserving objects in general, serves novelty as companies and consumers can always look back in terms of what was working and what was not, what was considered safe and what was not.
